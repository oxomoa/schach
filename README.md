# schach


## What is it?

**schach** is a chess game for web browsers written in JavaScript, embedded in a simple html/css website. It is designed for being used by two human players.


## Language issues

Sorry folks, but currently, almost the whole project (names of JavaScript variables and functions, code comments, file names) is available in German language only.
