# schach


## Background

Basically, **schach** is a chess game for web browsers written in JavaScript, embedded in a simple html/css website. It is designed for being used by two human players.


## Language issues

Sorry folks, but currently, almost the whole project (names of JavaScript variables and functions, code comments, file names) is available in German language only.


## License

The **schach** project is published under the [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), i.e. it is completely free of any license.
